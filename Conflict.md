### **How to Handle Conflict**

1. **Identify the Conflict:**  
    The first step in handling conflict is to identify the source of the conflict. This could be due to differences in opinions, goals, or approaches to a task.

2. **Communicate:**  
    Once the conflict is identified, it is important to communicate openly and honestly with the team members involved. This can help clarify misunderstandings and find common ground. If you are concerned about the conflict, you can ask for a meeting with the team members involved to discuss the issue and find a resolution. Additionally, send an email to the project chief to inform them about the conflict and ask for their advice. They will set up a meeting with the team members involved to discuss the issue and find a resolution.

3. **Personal Issues:**  
    If the conflict is due to personal issues, it is important to address these separately from the work-related conflict. Encourage team members to resolve personal issues outside of work and maintain a professional relationship in the workplace. In all cases, send an email to the project chief to inform them about the conflict and ask for their advice.

4. **Seek a Compromise:**  
    In some cases, a compromise may be necessary to resolve the conflict. This could involve finding a middle ground or adjusting expectations to accommodate different perspectives.

5. **Involve a Mediator:**  
    If the conflict persists and cannot be resolved internally, it may be helpful to involve a neutral third party as a mediator. This person can help facilitate communication and find a resolution that is acceptable to all parties involved.

6. **Document the Resolution:**  
    Once the conflict is resolved, it is important to document the resolution and any agreements made. This can help prevent similar conflicts in the future and provide a reference point for addressing conflicts that may arise later on.

7. **Follow Up:**  
    After the conflict is resolved, it is important to follow up with the team members involved to ensure that the resolution is working and that any lingering issues are addressed. This can help prevent future conflicts and maintain a positive working environment.

By following these steps, we can effectively handle conflict within the team and ensure that everyone can work together productively towards a common goal.
