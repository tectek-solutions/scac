# **Feature Development Process**

## **1. Feature Planning**

- **Create a GitHub Issue**:  
  - Open a new **GitHub issue** for the feature.  
  - Clearly describe the feature, including:
    - **Summary**: What the feature does.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific requirements the feature must meet.
    - **Additional Details**: Attachments like mockups, references, or diagrams.
  - Assign the issue to a milestone (MVP, Final Product) and use relevant labels (feature, priority-high).

---

## **2. Design & Approval**

- **Design Discussion**:  
  - Discuss the feature requirements, technical details, and UX design in **Microsoft Teams**.  
  - For features requiring significant design work (UI/UX), share mockups or diagrams for review.  

- **Approval**:  
  - Once the featureâ€™s design and approach are agreed upon, the issue is marked as **Ready to Start** and moved to the **To-Do** column in the **GitHub Project Board**.  

---

## **3. Development**

- **Branch Creation**:  
  - Create a new Git branch for the feature using a standardized naming convention, `feature/<feature-name>` (feature/login-page).  

- **Implementation**:  
  - Write the code to implement the feature, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met.  
  - Commit frequently with descriptive commit messages (Add login functionality).  

- **Task Tracking**:  
  - Move the issue on the **GitHub Project Board** to **In Progress** to track its status.  

---

## **4. Pull Request (PR)**

- **Submit the PR**:  
  - Once the feature is complete, submit a **pull request** from the feature branch to the main development branch (develop or main).  
  - Use a **PR template** and include:
    - **Description**: What the feature does and its impact.
    - **Linked Issue**: Reference the GitHub issue (Closes #123).
    - **Testing Steps**: How to verify the feature works as intended.
    - **Screenshots**: Attach any relevant images or outputs.

- **Code Review**:  
  - Assign reviewers to check the code for quality, standards compliance, and potential bugs.
  - Address reviewer feedback promptly and update the PR as needed.  

- **Automated & Manual Testing**:  
  - Ensure the feature passes automated CI tests (unit tests, integration tests).  
  - Perform manual testing for edge cases and usability.  

---

## **5. Merging & Deployment**

- **Merge the PR**:  
  - Once the PR is approved and all tests pass, merge it into the main development branch.  
  - The corresponding issue is automatically closed with the PR merge.  

- **Staging Deployment**:  
  - Deploy the merged feature to a **staging environment** for additional validation.  

---

## **6. Production Release**

- **Deployment**:  
  - Release the feature to production during a scheduled deployment window.  
  - Monitor the release to ensure everything works as intended.  

- **Post-Release Validation**:  
  - Verify the feature in production and address any immediate issues.  

- **Documentation**:  
  - Update project documentation to include details about the new feature, such as:
    - User guides or FAQs.
    - API or system documentation (if applicable).

---

## **Workflow Summary**

1. **Create Issue**: Define the feature and add it to the **GitHub Project Board**.
2. **Design Approval**: Discuss and approve the approach via Teams.
3. **Develop Feature**: Create a branch, code the feature, and track its progress.
4. **Submit PR**: Implement and test the feature, then submit a pull request.
5. **Review & Merge**: Complete the code review and merge the PR once approved.
6. **Staging & Testing**: Deploy to staging for validation.
7. **Release**: Deploy the feature to production and validate its functionality.
8. **Close Loop**: Update documentation and monitor for follow-up issues.
